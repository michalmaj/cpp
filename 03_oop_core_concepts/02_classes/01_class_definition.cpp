/*
 * In C++, we have several differnet data types like int, double, bool, char etc. An object can be created
 * out of any those types.An object is an instance of a class.
 * Classes are used to creat user-defined data types. We can use these basic data types to create our own
 * class. The cool part is that our class can contain multiple variables, pointers, and functions which
 * would be available to us whenever a class object is created.
 * In general, two categories of members, data and functions, are present in all classes.
 *
 * Data members are also known as the member variables of a class. This is because they contain the
 * information relevant to the object of the class.
 *
 * Member functions enable the class object to perform operations using the memebr variables.
 *
 * The reserved word class tells the compiler that we are creating our own custom class. All the members of
 * the class will be defined within the class scope.
